regularly receive from nek players hello and thank you for a fantastic game my wife and i spend many hours competing on the hand to hand game and we have a question for you in standard tetris the goal is of course to accumulate as many points as possible in nek the goal also is to stay alive when playing hand to hand game what would be the parameter to decide who wins we are now talking of a scenario where a has the most points but dies and b is alive but has fewer points this is really becoming an issue in the househould so if you could please give us your expert opinion we would be very grateful ed note the answer to the question in this message appears on the web site kind regards jesper annette skovlund denmark thank you very much nek is such an amazing game the ease of tetris with the added element of multiplayer network attack please let me know when version 2 is available i can t wait to buy it thanks again mike wow this game is phat i have been playing tetrinet for a while but this blows it away in every possible area worth the time d ling many times over joshua peters i ve just tried playing nek and i love it one thing would it be possible to have an option for the pieces to rotate in the opposite direction ed note this was introduced in the current version 2 0 of nek the tetris game i m used to rotates them the other way clockwise anti clockwise this would also make a nice weapon if it could also happen randomly thanks again simon hurr tetris is a trademark of the tetris company nek is a product of oceanus communications inc and is not manufactured
